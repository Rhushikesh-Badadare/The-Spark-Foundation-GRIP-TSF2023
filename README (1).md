# The Spark-Foundation task
This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for The Sparks Foundation.

Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
Internship Duration - 2 Month ( September-2023 )
Internship Type - Work from Home In this internship, They provided us with various Tasks and I was able to successfully complete the tasks within the given time frame.

# Task-1: Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
1. Predict the percentage of marks of a student based on the number of study hours.
2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
3. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
4. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner, or any other tool.
5. What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours/ day?

# Task-2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
1. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
2. Use R or Python or perform this task.
3. Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

# Task-3: Perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis'.
1. By using the 'SampleSuperstore' dataset perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis'.
2. As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make a profit.
3. What business problems you can derive from exploring the data?
4. Use Tableau as a data visualization tool.

# Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)
1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it will be able to predict the right class accordingly.
